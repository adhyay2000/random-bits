## SpeedTestClient
This is a python script that uses selenium to extract network speed data from open-source speedtest https://librespeed.org/. 

TODO:

1. Create a commandline tool from the script, that works in background and raises an alert when the data is extracted. 

2. Currently, the server is not selected. Use the  ip2location to find the IP and then select the nearest server.
